                I'm a 31 year old living in Center City, Philadelphia with my wife and two dogs.
                I grew up in Chicago, Frankfurt Germany, and Northern Virginia.
                I played Division 1 baseball during college (<a
                    href="https://www.mountathletics.com/sports/bsb/2010-11/bios/flynn_tommy00?view=bio">here's my
                    bio</a>).
                Once I realized I couldn't hit a curveball, I decided to go to law school.

            <p id="second">
                I graduated from law school in 2014.
                I've been working as an associate attorney since 2014 and currently specialize in real estate law. I'm
                barred to practice law in both Virginia and
                Pennsylvania.
                After
                moving to Philadelphia in 2015, I started a real estate investment company. We currently own around
                twenty units
                total in Philadelphia and Baltimore.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also have some startup experience. I was the first hire at a youth sports sponsorship startup in
                Philly and previously co-founded a peer-to-peer editing platform (it no longer exists...turns out
                people
                don't like
                things edited).
            </p>

            <p id="third">
                I'm also an obsessive hobbyist. I am a part-time professional poker player, a Class-A chess player
                (<a href="https://www.moron2master.com">follow my journey to master here!</a>), an amateur card
                magician, and
                occasionally a writer
                (<a href="https://medium.com/@tfly.flynn">here are some articles from the past</a>). I'm always
                looking
                to
                meet new people and experience new things.
